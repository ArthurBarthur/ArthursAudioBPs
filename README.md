# NEW Feature Examples in V9.6

- Submix meters(simple volume visualizers for submixes)
- Submix recording example(to soundwave or .wav)
- 3 different audio capture examples(incl recording and visualizing mic without hearing ourselves)

# Other V9.6 Improvements

- NoteRunner level with truly super duper random sounds every time 
- SpringKeys are performant now(they were auto-shutting off at 0 volume, causing stuttering. Now the oscs never hit 0 vol)
- Submix tweaker should be better
- hundreds of little things here and there

# Pre-existing Feature Examples

- Independent pitch and playback-speed control with granular player(thank you for HQ voice sample [Megagoth1702](https://forums.unrealengine.com/community/got-skills-looking-for-talent/looking-for-work/1710171))
- SpringKeys, a physical, springy piano synthesizer instrument
- Granular chord choir music instrument thing
- Basic Modulation Plugin example
- Spline-based variation on the frequency visualizers
- Single frequency audio-visualizer boxes as standalone things
- Crowd sim early alpha
- Live Submix Effect-tweaker knob
- Modulation plugin example
- More musical Rollplate-examples added
- Rollplates; an evolution of the existing noteplates. Registers rolling objects as well, and uses physics for note velocity.
- Source effects(user modulation while simulating)
- NoteRunner; synth music based on physics and world-Z
- Midi input/output
- Spatial propagation
- Modular Synth Preset Randomizer
- Spatial music
- Mic/Input capture
- Modular Synth
- visualization with single sound envelope followers
- submix FFT frequency analyzers and visualizers
- granular synthesis based door-hinges
- TimeSynth working as drum machine
- SourceBus, Submix and SourceEffect routing
