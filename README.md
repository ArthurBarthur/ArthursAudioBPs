# V1000
Huge refactor this time! Finally made a plugin, Arthurs Audio-Visual Toolkit. All the nice stuff is in there now, separated from the rest of the project. Super portable when we just want the tools over on a different project, instead of including ALL the example levels and stuff in it! 
The plugin should be on Unreal Marketplace soon, will update with link. For now this project works standalone no problem.
# Feature Examples

- Huge hub-level with gamemode, doors to all levels, lots of silly BPs and more.
- "Candy" Audio Visualizer
- Jump-pads that trigger samples(audio)
- Submix meters(practical and simple in-world volume visualizers for submixes)
- Submix recording example(to soundwave or .wav)
- Independent pitch and playback-speed control with granular player(thank you for HQ voice sample [Megagoth1702](https://forums.unrealengine.com/community/got-skills-looking-for-talent/looking-for-work/1710171))
- SpringKeys, a physical, springy piano synthesizer instrument
- Granular chord choir music instrument thing
- Basic Modulation Plugin example
- Spline-based variation on the frequency visualizers
- Single frequency audio-visualizer boxes as standalone things
- Crowd sim early alpha
- Live Submix Effect-tweaker knob
- Modulation plugin example
- More musical Rollplate-examples added
- Rollplates; an evolution of the existing noteplates. Registers rolling objects as well, and uses physics for note velocity.
- Source effects(user modulation while simulating)
- NoteRunner; synth music based on physics and world-Z
- Midi input/output
- Spatial propagation
- Modular Synth Preset Randomizer
- Spatial music
- Mic/Input capture
- 3 different audio capture examples(incl recording and visualizing mic without hearing ourselves)
- Modular Synth
- visualization with single sound envelope followers
- submix FFT frequency analyzers and visualizers
- granular synthesis based door-hinges
- TimeSynth working as drum machine
- SourceBus, Submix and SourceEffect routing
